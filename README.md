# Overview

A **Status Card** for Home Assistant Dashboards

I always wanted to make an overview card that shows a lot of entities without the need to change it like everyday. This card will show all relevant data in a quick look.
You only need to assign your entities/devices to your areas and the card will do the rest.

&nbsp; 
  <img alt="Dark" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xbourner/status-card/main/.github/img/status-card-dark.png" width="49%">
</p>

### How it works
 - ü§ñ **Auto generating card** - Works when entities/devices are assigned to areas
 - ‚úÖ **Based on entity states** - Shows entities that are in a on/active state (can be inverted)
 - üìö **Automatic Grouping** - Entities grouped by domain/device_class
 - ‚óæ **Extra Entities** - Missing some entities in the groups? Just add them via Extra Entities 
 - üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë **Smart Groups** - Make your own groups with custom filters 
 - üìë **Popup View** - Entities will render as Tile Cards in a new view
 - üß† **GUI Editor** - No code or scripts needed
 - üîß **Highly customizable** - almost everything customizable
 - üì± **Optimized for desktop and phones**
 - üåç **Available in all HA languages**

<br>

This card i highly influenced by [Dwains Dashboard](https://github.com/dwainscheeren/dwains-lovelace-dashboard). So now you can use this great idea as a single card in all of your Dashboards


## Installation

###  HACS Installation (Recommended)

Click this link to add **Status Card** to your Home Assistant:

### Usage:

After adding the repository to your HA instance you need to add the card to one of your dashboards. <br>
The card needs to work with your areas so you need to assign your relevant devices/entities to your areas.
