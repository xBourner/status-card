# Overview

A **Status Card** for Home Assistant Dashboards

I always wanted to make an overview card that shows a lot of entities without the need to change it like everyday. This card will show all relevant data in a quick look.
You only need to assign your entities/devices to your areas and the card will do the rest.

  <img alt="Dark" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xbourner/status-card/main/.github/img/status-card-dark.png" width="49%">
</p>

### How it works
 - 🤖 **Auto generating card** - Works when entities/devices are assigned to areas
 - ✅ **Based on entity states** - Shows entities that are in a on/active state (can be inverted)
 - 📚 **Automatic Grouping** - Entities grouped by domain/device_class
 - ◾ **Extra Entities** - Missing some entities in the groups? Just add them via Extra Entities 
 - 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Smart Groups** - Make your own groups with custom filters 
 - 📑 **Popup View** - Entities will render as Tile Cards in a new view
 - 🧠 **GUI Editor** - No code or scripts needed
 - 🔧 **Highly customizable** - almost everything customizable
 - 📱 **Optimized for desktop and phones**
 - 🌍 **Available in all HA languages**

This card i highly influenced by [Dwains Dashboard](https://github.com/dwainscheeren/dwains-lovelace-dashboard). So now you can use this great idea as a single card in all of your Dashboards
